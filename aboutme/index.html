    <p>Hello everyone! I work at BYU-Idaho in the scheduling office and love my job. I have been married for 19 years and we have four wonderful kids. 
    <p>I have been working with computer programs with work and wanted to learn more about web development and design. My daughter has also been taking these classes in her high school classes and we have both found it interesting.</p>  
    <p>I love the gospel and love that we have a temple so close. As I am studying talks and scriptures online I will often take screenshots of favorite quotes and scriptures. Here is one I have recently from President Monson, "A sunflower always turns its face to the sun. By evening the sunflower faces the setting sun. We need to turn our face to the Son, Jesus Christ, and follow His example as a sunflower follows the sunshine. By learning of Him, by believing Him, by following Him, there is the capacity to become like Him." Sunflowers have become my favorite flower because of this quote and how they remind me to always look to Him.</p>
