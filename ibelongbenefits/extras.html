            <p>A great perk is the I-belong app. On the app you not only can find events and sign up for groups that you want to follow and get more information about. There are several extras that are all conveniently located in the app. There is a campus map that is interactive and can help you find where you need to go on the large campus. You can click on canvas and get to your schoolwork quickly. There are also spots to take you to the academic calendar, the BYU-I housing marketplace if you are looking for a place to live, a student employment job board, peer mentoring meeting scheduler, schedule a student study room, the ticket office website, and my favorite, a digital copy of your I-card. Another great reason to use I-belong is for departments and faculty. You have so many options to communicate with students through newsletters, email, and text messages through the I-belong app. There are also ways to check in attendees to your events through I-belong so that you can see who is coming and get more data and feedback with after event surveys or questionnaires.</p>
